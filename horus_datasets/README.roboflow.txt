The dataset includes 1029 images.
Plants-plague-detector are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 416x416 (Fit (black edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.9 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.14 percent of pixels
